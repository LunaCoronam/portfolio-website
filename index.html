<h1>Burak Aytaç</h1>
<h2>Game Designer</h2>
</p>I'm a Game Designer with 4+ years of experience. I specialize in systems design, combat design, and core gameplay loops. 
  My focus is on creating core gameplay loops, interconnected systems, and long term replayability. 
  I enjoy building scalable designs — systems that produce depth through interaction rather than content volume primarily.
  I've worked on multiple game projects, ranging from small hyper-casual games to larger indie titles.
